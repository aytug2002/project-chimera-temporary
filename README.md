**Project Chimera is an advanced AI agent designed to overcome the critical limitations of standard Large Language Models (LLMs) in strategic business environments. By integrating a hybrid Neuro-Symbolic-Causal architecture, this agent makes decisions that are not only intelligent but also safe, explainable, and provably profitable.**

## ‚ùó The Problem: Why Raw LLMs are Dangerous for Business

Modern LLMs are powerful, but when entrusted with critical business decisions, they can be dangerously naive and unpredictable. Without proper guardrails, they can make catastrophic mistakes. Our benchmark experiment proves this: we tasked a pure `LLM-Only` agent with managing a simulated e-commerce business for one year. Lacking an understanding of rules or the causal consequences of its actions, it drove the company into a **multi-billion dollar loss**.

---

## üí° The Solution: The Chimera Agent in Action

Project Chimera solves this by providing the LLM with a **Symbolic** safety net and a **Causal** oracle. It doesn't just guess; it brainstorms multiple strategies, checks them against business rules, and predicts their financial outcomes to find the optimal path.

You can try a **live demo** of the Strategy Lab here:

## üß© The Chimera Architecture

![The Chimera Architecture](assets/architecture.png)

* **üß† Neuro (The Brain):** The creative core (GPT-4o) that understands goals and brainstorms diverse strategies.  
* **üõ°Ô∏è Symbolic (The Guardian):** A rule engine that acts as a safety net, preventing catastrophic, rule-breaking decisions.  
* **üîÆ Causal (The Oracle):** A data-driven causal inference engine (`EconML`) that predicts the profit impact of potential decisions.

---

### ‚ú® Key Features

* **Multi-Hypothesis Reasoning:** The agent actively brainstorms and evaluates multiple strategies before making a data-driven recommendation.
* **Dynamic Learning from Experience:** The agent's Causal Engine (CausalEngineV6) retrains periodically on its own performance data, allowing it to adapt and improve.
* **Advanced XAI Suite:** Go beyond "black box" predictions with:
    * **Per-Decision Explainability:** A SHAP-based panel that shows the factors driving each specific decision.
    * **Interactive 'What-If' Simulator:** A tool to explore the agent's mind by changing market conditions and seeing how its predictions change in real-time.
* **Advanced Economic Simulator:** A sophisticated simulation environment featuring non-linear dynamics like price elasticity and diminishing returns.
* **Interactive Strategy Lab:** A full-featured Streamlit application (`app.py`) for real-time interaction and analysis.
* **Automated Benchmarking Suite:** A powerful research script (`benchmark.py`) to rigorously compare different agent architectures.

## üî¨Advanced XAI: From Glass Box to Interactive Simulator
Version 1.2.1 introduces a full suite of XAI tools. We didn't just want to see why the agent made a decision; we wanted to interact with its reasoning. The new **"What-If Analysis"** tab allows you to do exactly that‚Äîexplore the agent's mind by testing counterfactual scenarios live.

# Chimera v1.2.3 - Formal Verification (TLA+)

## Purpose
SymbolicGuardianV4 introduces a configurable safety buffer above the minimum safe price threshold to eliminate rounding/precision edge‚Äëcase violations observed in formal analysis.  
This verification ensures that the repair logic **always** enforces:
- Buffered minimum profit margin
- Maximum price cap
- Absolute and relative advertising spend caps

The model is written in TLA+ and checked with the TLC model checker to provide mathematical confidence in these safety guarantees.


## Results Summary (Run: 2025‚Äë09‚Äë17)

![TLA+ Run Result](TLA+_verification/img/tla+_run_result.png)

- **Distinct states explored:** 7,639,419  
- **Diameter reached:** 5  
- **Invariant violations:** 0  
- **Observed fingerprint collision probability:** ~1.85‚ÄØ√ó‚ÄØ10‚Åª‚Åπ  
- **Calculated upper bound:** 6.95‚ÄØ√ó‚ÄØ10‚Åª‚Åµ

**Interpretation:**  
Under the modeled nondeterminism over price and advertising proposals, TLC exhaustively explored millions of states without finding any violation of the defined safety properties. The observed collision probability is far below the calculated bound, supporting the reliability of the result.

### üó∫Ô∏è Future Roadmap

Project Chimera is a living project. The next steps in our vision include:
* **Multi-Agent Competitive Simulations:** Evolving the benchmark into an ecosystem where multiple Chimera agents compete against each other in the same market.
* **Domain-Agnostic Framework:** Refactoring the core logic into a general-purpose framework for other domains like finance or healthcare.
* **Autonomous Learning & Self-Improvement:** Enabling the agent to not just learn from data, but to actively run its own experiments to discover new causal relationships in the environment.
